        "description": "• 背景：国际站作为平台型电商，缺乏定价权（商品/物流），\"省钱\"场景难以定义，用户心智建立困难。\n• 方法：我带领小组充分分析调研用户成交特征，确立全平台认可的低价商品标准；利用AI同款比价技术筛选低价商品，推出\"同款低价\"功能，强化场景心智；联合商家、行业团队，深度挖掘开发低价商品，提升买家匹配度。\n• 成果：Top Deals 场景渗透率提升285%，场景交易买家数激增161%，场景供给增长7倍。",
        "descriptionEn": "• Background: As a platform-based e-commerce, the international site lacks pricing power (products/logistics), making it difficult to define 'savings' scenarios and establish user mindset.\n• Method: Led the team to analyze user transaction characteristics, established platform-wide low-price standards; utilized AI price comparison technology for similar products, launched 'Same Item Lower Price' feature; collaborated with merchants and industry teams to develop low-price products.\n• Results: Top Deals scene penetration increased by 285%, scene transaction buyers surged by 161%, scene supply grew 7 times."

        "description": "• 背景：会员下单频次与红包数量强绑定、平台缺乏可持续增长下单频次的抓手。\n• 方法：创新融合消费游戏化运营思维：设计「福利金虚拟货币体系」，通过用户下单自动发放，叠加任务激励等手段推动下单频次增长，同步推动平台与商家成本共担模型落地。\n• 成果：月频次提升0.23单，其中任务体系贡献 0.1-0.15单（对比首页排序策略年均仅提升0.5单），在低新增预算前提下突破增长瓶颈。",
        "descriptionEn": "• Background: Member order frequency was strongly tied to coupon quantity, and the platform lacked sustainable tools for order frequency growth.\n• Method: Innovatively integrated gamification concepts: designed a 'welfare points virtual currency system', automatically distributed through user orders, combined with task incentives to drive order frequency growth, while implementing a cost-sharing model between platform and merchants.\n• Results: Monthly frequency increased by 0.23 orders, with task system contributing 0.1-0.15 orders (compared to homepage sorting strategy's annual increase of only 0.5 orders), breaking through growth bottlenecks under low budget constraints."
