          description: `背景：
国际站作为平台型电商，缺乏定价权（商品/物流），"省钱"场景难以定义，用户心智建立困难。

方法：
我带领小组充分分析调研用户成交特征，确立全平台认可的低价商品标准；利用AI同款比价技术筛选低价商品，推出"同款低价"功能，强化场景心智；联合商家、行业团队，深度挖掘开发低价商品，提升买家匹配度。

成果：
Top Deals场景渗透率提升285%，场景交易买家数增长161%，场景供给增长7倍。`,
          descriptionEn: `Background:
As a platform-based e-commerce website, the international site lacks pricing control (products/logistics), making it challenging to define "money-saving" scenarios and establish user mindset.

Approach:
Led the team to analyze user transaction characteristics, established platform-wide low-price product standards; utilized AI price comparison technology to select low-price products, launched "Same Item, Lower Price" feature to strengthen scenario awareness; collaborated with merchants and industry teams to develop low-price products, improving buyer matching.

Results:
Top Deals scenario penetration increased by 285%, transaction buyers grew by 161%, and supply increased 7-fold.`
